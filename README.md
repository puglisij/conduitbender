# conduitbender
An advanced calculator for computing mechanical and by-hand conduit bend markings.

Most the code under Assets/ConduitBenderUltimate was written by myself. 
This project was a bit of a spontaneous, if not random (and admittedly at times boring), undertaking but was a great learning experience and is one of the largest most complete personal projects to date. 

Some of those learned things include:
* Building a Unity app from start to finish
* Derivation of interesting Trigonometry equations for certain bends
* That Unity's uGUI system can feel a bit unwieldy/convoluted at times (e.g. the Layout system)
* That "I'll come back and clean up this code later" is a dangerous thought
* The Polishing stage is A Lot of work
* I should have hired an experienced UI designer for a more professional look X)
